# Angular Items list App
## About the project
I wrote a items list application.
In this project, I used a design that I really liked.
## Project URL
https://dorlevi121.github.io/dorlevi121-dor-levi-5-8-22/%60/items/delivery
## How to run the project locally
1. Install node.js, if you haven't yet. Grab the LTS release from https://nodejs.org/en/.
2. Open a new command prompt or terminal and change to the directory where you cloned the repo. To be sure you're in the right place, make sure you can see a file named ``` package.json.```
3. In this command prompt/terminal window, execute this command:  ``` npm install ``` .  This will download and install all the dependencies.
4. Once everything is installed, you should be able to run the Angular app. Everything I mentioned already only need to be done before you run it the first time. To ensure you are in the right folder, navigate to where your ```index.html``` is located and run this command: ```ng serve```. If ng cannot be found, you may need to install it. To do so, execute ```npm install --save-dev @angular/cli```. Now it should work. If not, close your command prompt/terminal window, open a new one and try ```ng serve``` again.
5. Once  ```ng serve ``` is finished compiling, you should be able to view your app by opening http://localhost:4200 in your favourite browser.
